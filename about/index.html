Hello, I&rsquo;m Ziemek Borowski, and I used to be the postmaster.
I have quite extensive experience as an e-mail technical administrator for large organizations. Let&rsquo;s call me myself postmaster. But mostly based on proprietary solution – to say direct – MS Exchange Server and ancestor – M365 Exchange Online. I worked also with Google Workspace or (in past) Lotus/IBM/HCL Domino/Notes. I had some experience with open source, but it was on production years ago (20-ish). I decided to explore some alternative approaches in many different directions and report here, on that yet-another-technical-blog my concerns and findings."><meta name=author content="Ziemek Borowski"><link rel=canonical href=https://blog.ehlo.pl/about/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://blog.ehlo.pl/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://blog.ehlo.pl/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://blog.ehlo.pl/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://blog.ehlo.pl/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://blog.ehlo.pl/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://blog.ehlo.pl/about/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.ehlo.pl/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="ehlo.pl - modern e-mail?"><meta property="og:title" content="ehlo.pl - modern e-mail?"><meta property="og:description" content="Modern e-mail solutions blog – about-me Hello, I’m Ziemek Borowski, and I used to be the postmaster.
