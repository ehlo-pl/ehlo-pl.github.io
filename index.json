Some examples? There are: postfix as on-premises mail submission / relay for LoB applications (sending sometimes to regular e-mail organization, sometimes to external smart-hosts) postfix as build from scratch, not ready to go mail site (yeah, trivial, but bless and horror of open source is - every build it in own way). Yes, there are https://www.iredmail.org/ or https://modoboa.org/en/features/ - but I want back to roots and look under the hood. explore new mail organization solutions - mostly open-sources. Some initial examples: WildDuck email server - but it also include i.e. ZoneMTA and Haraka to validate recipient addresses and quota usage against the WildDuck users database and to store/filter messages. ANCT, a French government agency project Messages [stalwart] (https://github.com/stalwartlabs/stalwart) - All-in-one Mail \u0026amp; Collaboration server.
