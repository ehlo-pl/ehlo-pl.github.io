# Note to self: ICMP and TCP connectivity Looking glasses


1.**Looking Glass**: A Looking Glass is a tool available on a network (often provided by Internet Service Providers, ISPs) that allows users to perform network diagnostic operations, such as route tracing and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) routing table viewing.

This tool is valuable for network administrators in managing nodes on the Internet. For example, it can help diagnose network routing problems, assess network latency, or check how network traffic is being directed from one node to another. It can also be used to debug BGP setup, which is vital for the operation of the internet since BGP is responsible for the routing of traffic between different ISPs.

By using a Looking Glass service, a network administrator can understand how traffic is flowing between their network's nodes and other networks. This can help identify issues such as inefficient routing or potential points of failure in the network.
