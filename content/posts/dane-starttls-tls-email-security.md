## Why Email Encryption is Weird

[Unlike HTTPS - the unique challenges]

## DANE: SPF for TLS Certificates

[DNS-based authentication of named entities]

## STARTTLS Negotiation and Downgrade Attacks

[Security considerations in opportunistic encryption]

## Practical Implementation

[Lab TLS setup and configuration]

## Packet Capture Examples

[Real-world examples of TLS negotiation]

**Preparation notes:**
- Lab TLS setup (2h)
- Writing (3.5h)
- Packet capture examples (1.5h)
